# Jashnsaz_STARProtocols_2021
core codes and data generated for Jashnsaz_STARProtocols_2021 and Jashnsaz_iScience_2020 

These codes are generated in MATLAB R2019a and includes the following: 

Jashnsaz_et_al_dir01_Models to generate the models and visualize them. 
Jashnsaz_et_al_dir02_simData to generate simulated data.  
Jashnsaz_et_al_dir03_FisherInformationMatrix to implement Fisher Information Matrix analysis. 
Jashnsaz_et_al_dir04_Bayesian to implement Bayesian analysis. 
Jashnsaz_et_al_dir05_MLEs to train the model with different training data conditions and to evaluate the model predictions 
Jashnsaz_et_al_dir06_GeneratePumpProfiles to set up and generate pump profiles for time-varying cell stimulations
Jashnsaz_et_al_dir07_CellGrowth to calculate the inoculation volumes for cell cultures
