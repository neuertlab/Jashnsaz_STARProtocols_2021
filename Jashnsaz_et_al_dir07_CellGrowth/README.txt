The MATLAB code OD600_calculation.m calculates the inoculation volumes to start multiple cell cultures from independent pre-cultures to reach desired OD600 the next day.  

1. Specify parameters (the lines 7 to 38), run the code. 
2. The code prints and saves the table of calculation. See the last 3 lines in the code for the printer setup.
